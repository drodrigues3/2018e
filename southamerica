# Brazil

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
# The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules
# just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.
# The rule change lasted only part of the day;
# the federal government refused to follow the city's rules, and business
# was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.

# From IATA SSIM (1996-02):
# _Only_ the following states in BR1 observe DST: Rio Grande do Sul (RS),
# Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ),
# Espírito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Bahia (BA), Goiás (GO),
# Distrito Federal (DF), Tocantins (TO), Sergipe [SE] and Alagoas [AL].
# [The last three states are new to this issue of the IATA SSIM.]

# From Gwillim Law (1996-10-07):
# Geography, history (Tocantins was part of Goiás until 1989), and other
# sources of time zone information lead me to believe that AL, SE, and TO were
# always in BR1, and so the only change was whether or not they observed DST....
# The earliest issue of the SSIM I have is 2/91.  Each issue from then until
# 9/95 says that DST is observed only in the ten states I quoted from 9/95,
# along with Mato Grosso (MT) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), which are in BR2
# (UTC-4)....  The other two time zones given for Brazil are BR3, which is
# UTC-5, no DST, and applies only in the state of Acre (AC); and BR4, which is
# UTC-2, and applies to Fernando de Noronha (formerly FN, but I believe it's
# become part of the state of Pernambuco).  The boundary between BR1 and BR2
# has never been clearly stated.  They've simply been called East and West.
# However, some conclusions can be drawn from another IATA manual: the Airline
# Coding Directory, which lists close to 400 airports in Brazil.  For each
# airport it gives a time zone which is coded to the SSIM.  From that
# information, I'm led to conclude that the states of Amapá (AP), Ceará (CE),
# Maranhão (MA), Paraíba (PR), Pernambuco (PE), Piauí (PI), and Rio Grande do
# Norte (RN), and the eastern part of Pará (PA) are all in BR1 without DST.

# From Celso Doria via David Madeo (2002-10-09):
# The reason for the delay this year has to do with elections in Brazil.
#
# Unlike in the United States, elections in Brazil are 100% computerized and
# the results are known almost immediately.  Yesterday, it was the first
# round of the elections when 115 million Brazilians voted for President,
# Governor, Senators, Federal Deputies, and State Deputies.  Nobody is
# counting (or re-counting) votes anymore and we know there will be a second
# round for the Presidency and also for some Governors.  The 2nd round will
# take place on October 27th.
#
# The reason why the DST will only begin November 3rd is that the thousands
# of electoral machines used cannot have their time changed, and since the
# Constitution says the elections must begin at 8:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM,
# the Government decided to postpone DST, instead of changing the Constitution
# (maybe, for the next elections, it will be possible to change the clock)...

# From Rodrigo Severo (2004-10-04):
# It's just the biannual change made necessary by the much hyped, supposedly
# modern Brazilian eletronic voting machines which, apparently, can't deal
# with a time change between the first and the second rounds of the elections.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-09-20):
# Brazil will start DST on 2007-10-14 00:00 and end on 2008-02-17 00:00:
# http://www.mme.gov.br/site/news/detail.do;jsessionid=BBA06811AFCAAC28F0285210913513DA?newsId=13975

# From Paul Schulze (2008-06-24):
# ...by law number 11.662 of April 24, 2008 (published in the "Diario
# Oficial da União"...) in Brazil there are changes in the timezones,
# effective today (00:00am at June 24, 2008) as follows:
#
# a) The timezone UTC+5 is extinguished, with all the Acre state and the
# part of the Amazonas state that had this timezone now being put to the
# timezone UTC+4
# b) The whole Pará state now is put at timezone UTC+3, instead of just
# part of it, as was before.
#
# This change follows a proposal of senator Tiao Viana of Acre state, that
# proposed it due to concerns about open television channels displaying
# programs inappropriate to youths in the states that had the timezone
# UTC+5 too early in the night. In the occasion, some more corrections
# were proposed, trying to unify the timezones of any given state. This
# change modifies timezone rules defined in decree 2.784 of 18 June,
# 1913.

# From Rodrigo Severo (2008-06-24):
# Just correcting the URL:
# https://www.in.gov.br/imprensa/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=do&secao=1&pagina=1&data=25/04/2008
#
# As a result of the above Decree I believe the America/Rio_Branco
# timezone shall be modified from UTC-5 to UTC-4 and a new timezone shall
# be created to represent the...west side of the Pará State. I
# suggest this new timezone be called Santarem as the most
# important/populated city in the affected area.
#
# This new timezone would be the same as the Rio_Branco timezone up to
# the 2008/06/24 change which would be to UTC-3 instead of UTC-4.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-24):
# This is a quick reference page for New and Old Brazil Time Zones map.
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/brazil-time-new-old.php
#
# - 4 time zones replaced by 3 time zones - eliminating time zone UTC-05
# (state Acre and the part of the Amazonas will be UTC/GMT-04) - western
# part of Par state is moving to one timezone UTC-03 (from UTC-04).

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-10):
# The official decrees referenced below are mostly taken from
# Decretos sobre o Horário de Verão no Brasil.
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/DecHV.html

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-08-29):
# As announced by the government and many newspapers in Brazil late
# yesterday, Brazil will start DST on 2008-10-19 (need to change rule) and
# it will end on 2009-02-15 (current rule for Brazil is fine). Based on
# past years experience with the elections, there was a good chance that
# the start was postponed to November, but it did not happen this year.
